# Web Developer Toolkit

Collection of handy tools for daily work of front end developer

## Usage

This browser-based application will include such useful tools as dynamic browser size checker, random colour picker, px/em converter, and more.

## Work in progress

Needs to be done :

JavaScript:

- the logic for px to em converter : in the first window, the user will be entering base font in px; in the second or third the user will be entering a number to convert, either in px or em, and by clicking the button the conversion will appear in the last window.
 Example : 
           Base size : 16px, PX size: 32px, EM size: 2em;
           Base size : 12px, PX size: 18px, EM size: 1.5em;
           Base size : 20px, PX size: 20px, EM size: 1em;

CSS:

- design the page layout
- make it responsive by adding multiple stylesheets for different media queries
